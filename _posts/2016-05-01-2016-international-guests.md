Pro rider for Team Naish, 2013 Red Bull King of the Air and making kitesurfing history with the first successful kitesurfing barrel at Jaws, Maui; Jesse is always pushing the limits of extreme kitesurfing.

We’re super excited to welcome Jesse back to Aitutaki again this year and look forward to his extreme, energetic kiting and fun sense of humour. '

Describing himself as "Two times Kitesurfing World Champion on a quest for any and every way to have fun through an intense adrenaline rush" few have dominated the sport (or nailed as many death-defying stunts) as Jesse during his decade long career as a professional athlete. Pro rider for Team Naish, 2013 Red Bull King of the Air and making kitesurfing history with the first successful kitesurfing barrel at Jaws, Maui; Jesse is always pushing the limits of extreme kitesurfing. He also ranks the Cook Islands as one of his favourite places to kite. We're super excited to welcome Jesse back to Aitutaki again this year and look forward to his extreme, energetic kiting and fun sense of humour. 

## Ewan Jaspan ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0fd78eae-2e4d-4868-aa6f-ba1169aec760.jpg)

Ewan is Australasia's number one kitesurfing freestyle champion and pro rider for Team Naish. Pushing himself to new levels, Ewan is on a winning streak, recently securing top rankings in the National Kitesurfing League state event, the National Australian/NZ Finals as well as the Victorian State Titles. Ewan has recently been riding and judging in Egypt and France and training in Turkey for the Triple S. Ewan rates Brazil as the best place to train but says: "Aitutaki is also one of my favourite places to ride, the wind may not be quite as relentless as Brazil, but it's far more beautiful and kiting there is pretty special. Honeymoon Island is a kite paradise, and there aren't any places in the world I would rather ride."

Tavita has been involved in Manureva Aquafest since its inception playing a leading role in its growth and success as a fun watersports festival that showcases Aitutaki as a world class kitesurfing destination. A natural kitesurfer with his own inspiring and unique style, Tavita is happiest when he's racing and pulling kiteloops! Tavita also loves customising his kitesurfing gear and recently created the twin-tip "Alaia" kiteboard, made from natural wood which he first demo'ed at Manureva Aquafest 2015\.
